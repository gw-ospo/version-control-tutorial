# Text Editor

We'll be using software called a **text editor** to create and edit files of code. Similar to word processing software like Microsoft Word, text editors allow us to write and save documents of text. But unlike word processors, which save extra metadata (e.g. styles and formatting) along with the underling text, text editors save files comprised of just text.

There are many text editor options out there, and it seems each developer has their own preference. Regardless of which text editor you choose, you are highly encouraged to configure it with certain plugins, packages and extensions to enhance your experience and save you time.

## VS Code

Our preferred text editor is called Visual Studio Code, or \"VS Code\" for short.

### Installation and Configuration

Unless you already have a text editor of choice, install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Success Criteria

You should be able to open the VS Code application.
