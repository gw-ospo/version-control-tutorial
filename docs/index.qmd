# Version Control Basics
:::


Demystify the version control process and learn how to manage and collaborate on coding projects with other researchers and developers. Attendees will become familiar with Git and GitHub.

## Learning Objectives

1. Discuss the importance of version control in software and research development projects.
2. Set up a GitHub repository for version control purposes.
3. Use GitHub Desktop software to manage the code staging and committing process, and to interface with a remote repository on GitHub.
4. Employ Git branching strategies to manage different versions of code.
5. Collaborate with peers by pulling and merging changes from a shared repository.
6. Troubleshoot common Git errors and conflicts during version control.

## Prerequisites

This workshop requires the following software:

+ GitHub Desktop (requires a GitHub account)
+ VS Code Text Editor

If you have never worked with these tools before, we will walk you through how to install them. Just follow the [Version Control Tools Setup Guide](./prereqs/index.qmd).

## Agenda

+ 0:00 - Welcome and Announcements:
  + Make sure you have already installed the prerequisite software before the workshop.
  + For all workshop exercises, beginners are encouraged to use GitHub Desktop, but any participant desiring further exploration can use the Git CLI instead.

+ 0:05 - [Version Control Terminology and Concepts](./notes/version-control.qmd)
+ 0:10 - ["Hello Version Control" Exercise](./exercises/hello-version-control/index.qmd):
  + Gain familiarity with basic version control operations, including creating repositories, pushing and pulling code, and making commits.
+ 0:30 - ["Pull Request Workflow" Exercise](./exercises/pull-request-workflow/index.qmd):
  + Adopt a Pull Request Workflow to collaborate with yourself (on independent projects).
+ 0:50 - ["Developer Team Collaboration" Exercise](./exercises/developer-team-collaboration/index.qmd):
  + Adopt a Pull Request Workflow to collaborate with teammates, on team projects where you have write access to the repository.
+ 0:70 - ["Open Source Collaboration" Exercise](./exercises/open-source-collaboration/index.qmd):
  + Adopt a Pull Request Workflow to collaborate with people you don't know, on open source projects where you don't have write access to the repository.
+ 0:90 - Stop


The agenda above is for a 90 minute workshop, however for a 60 minute workshop, choose either the team exercise or open source exercise, and do the other for homework / self-practice.
